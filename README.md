## 👋 Hey, I'm Mikolaj Mikuliszyn

🎓 1st Year BSc Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at the University of Greenwich  
🧠 Exploring emotional cognition in AI, quantum-enhanced learning systems, and the edge of artificial general intelligence.

📚 Currently focused on:  
- Simulating malicious emotional AI (Malicious Mind)  
- AI personality cloning and memory simulation (Project Julia)  
- Turning technical projects into polished public showcases  
- Building a high-tier developer portfolio
