## 👋 Hey, I'm Mikolaj Mikuliszyn

🎓 1st Year BSc Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at University of Greenwich

🧠 Exploring emotional cognition in AI and quantum-enhanced learning systems

📚 Current focus: simulating malicious emotional AI (Malicious Mind), AI-personality cloning (Project Julia), and building a reputation through real, measurable projects

## 🔭 Current Projects


#### 🎓 Coursework Projects

###### 📦 Prime Finder in Binary Strings (Python – ADS) – Efficient extraction of prime numbers from binary substrings using optimized substring caching and primality testing. (Python, algorithm design, unittest)
 
###### 👨‍👩‍👧 Family Tree Management System (Python – CW1) – TUI-based system for modeling family relationships using custom classes and Python dataclasses. Supports age queries, birthday filters, and ancestral structure traversal. (Object-oriented design, CLI logic)
 
###### 🧬 Family Tree Analysis (Scheme - CW2) – Recursive Racket CLI program for analyzing family structures, lifespan logic, and structural mutation. (Functional programming – Scheme/Racket)

#### 🛠️ Personal Projects
###### 🚗 Randomized Car Generator – Pygame-based simulation of randomly spawning cars to explore event-based lifetimes, spawn logic, and 2D rendering. (Pygame, simulation design)
###### 🌌 Celestial Body Simulator – Real-time gravitational simulation of orbital motion between celestial objects, built with NumPy physics and Pygame rendering. (Physics modeling, interaction systems)
